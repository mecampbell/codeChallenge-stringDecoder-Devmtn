In this challenge, youâ€™ll write a decoder.

Write a function that takes in a string and returns a string. A valid argument is a number followed by a sequence of letters. Ex. 2fcjjm

The number in the string represents how many characters each letter should shift. For example:

>>> "1a" // "b"
>>> "3ce" // "fh"
>>> "2fcjjm" // "hello"
